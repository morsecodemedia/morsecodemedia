## About Me

With over two decades of experience in web development and leadership across B2B, B2C, Government, and Pharma Advertising, I excel at crafting innovative technical solutions and aligning them with business goals. As a strategic leader, I drive technology roadmaps, manage global teams, and collaborate with stakeholders to deliver high-quality, compliant, and impactful projects. My expertise spans pharma platforms like Veeva CRM, CMS solutions like AEM, modern JavaScript frameworks, cloud infrastructure, and emerging technologies like GenAI. Passionate about innovation, I bridge technical vision with client needs to create scalable, future-ready solutions.

I am available for freelance development work.
